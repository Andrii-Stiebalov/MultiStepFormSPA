# MultiStepFormSPA 📋

This is the implementation of Multi Step Form.

Project time: 3 days 🛰

[DEMO LINL](https://andrii-stiebalov.github.io/MultiStepFormSPA/)

## Used technologies:
 Vue👽
 
 SCSS👛
 
 WebPack📦
 
 MultiSelect.vue📋
 
 elementUi.vue🌐
 
 and 
 
 Wrote my own component to implement the collapse 🤓
 
 ## Mistakes 🐥
 Naming: I'm currently reading the book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. There, all the naming is written in CamelCase and after reading it, I forgot about class naming and instead of using BEM I wrote in CamelCase, when I noticed it was already too late.😅
